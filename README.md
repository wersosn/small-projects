## General info
This repository is primarily intended for small projects that test my knowledge of specific languages/topics/frameworks etc.
I want to start with the basics before I start a big, personal project. I'll see how it goes. Wish me luck.

## Setup
To run these projects, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wersosn/small-projects.git
```
