## To-do list
_30.07.2024, 01.08.2024_

## General info
This time I decided to make a to-do list. Another simple app, I know. You can only add and delete tasks.
I wanted to better understand how to manage inputs from the user and how to properly use HTML DOM.
At the same time - I started learning NodeJS and SQL (I already know the basics, so now I'll focus on how to create my own database and how to use it).
I'll create a more advanced version of this app (with better design) in the future.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
