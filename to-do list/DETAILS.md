## To-do lisst
_30.07.2024-??_

## General info
This time I decided to make a to-do list. Another simple app, I know.
I wanted to better understand how to manage inputs from the user and how to properly use HTML DOM.
At the same time - I started learning NodeJS and SQL (I already know the basics, so now I'll focus on how to create my own database and how to use it).

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
