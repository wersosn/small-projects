##Scientific calculator
_26.07.2024-27.07.2024_

##General info
Another calculator, this time I tried to recreate the scientific calculator available in Windows 10.
More options = more fun. However, I couldn't get the brackets to work, so it's better not to use them. 
Perhaps I'll come back to this project later and fix this problem.
